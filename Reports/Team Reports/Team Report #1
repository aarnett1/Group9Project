1. Goals From a Week Ago
  Since it is the first week, we currently do not have any goals from last week.
2. Progress Made This Week
  This week, we created our team GitHub Repository and Group 9 project Google Doc. We also created individual Trello accounts and then created a Trello Group 9 project. The team also created a Trello board which included four lists: backlog, to do, doing, and done. We all assigned two backlog assignments to each individual team member. The team also added a list with the links for our group to easily access.
3. Plans and Goals
  Our plans for next week are to finish our individual Software Engineering assignments, as well as to complete Sprint 2 together once we meet as a group. Currently, because we are still in the preparation phase of our assignment, these tasks are assigned to everyone.
4. Agenda for Meeting With Instructional Team
  The TA we met with on March 18th told us that, during our instructional team meeting, we would discuss our past sprint assignments. During this time, he would grade the assignment with us and explain anything which we found to be confusing. Currently, we plan to meet this week and discuss Sprint 1.
